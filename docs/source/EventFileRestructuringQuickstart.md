# Event file restructuring quickstart

This tutorial works through the process of restructuring event files using the HED event file remodeling tools.
The tools, which are written in Python, are designed to be run on an entire BIDS dataset.
The tools can be run using a command-line script, called from a Jupyter notebook,
or run using online tools. This quickstart covers the basic concepts of remodeling and
develops some basic examples of how remodeling is used. See the 
[**File remodeling tools**](https://hed-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FileRemodelingTools.html#)
guide for detailed descriptions of the available operations.

## What is event file restructuring?

The event files in an experiment provide a crucial link between what happens in
the experiment and the experimental data by providing identified time markers
linked to the timeline of the experiment.

Event files are often initially created using information in the logs files
generated by the experiment's presentation software or other control software.
These event files are then used to identify portions of the data
corresponding to particular points or blocks of data to be analyzed or compared.

Event file restructuring refers to creating, modifying, and
reorganizing the event markers in tabular files in order to
disambiguate or clarify the information for distribution and analysis.
Restructuring can occur at several stages during the acquisition and processing
of experimental data as shown in this schematic diagram:  
![schematic diagram](./_static/images/RestructureWeb.png).  

In addition to restructuring during initial creation of the tabular event files,
restructuring may be required when the event files do not conform to the requirements
of a particular analysis.
Thus, restructuring is an iterative process,
which is supported by the HED remodeling tools for datasets with tabular event files.

The following table gives a summary of the tools available in the HED remodeling toolbox.

````

The **clean-up** commands are used at various phases of restructuring to assure consistency
across event files in the dataset.

The **factor** commands produce column vectors of the same length as the events file
that encode condition variables, design matrices, or satisfaction of other search criteria.
See the 
[**HED conditions and design matrices**](https://hed-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/HedConditionsAndDesignMatrices.html)
for more information on factoring and analysis.

The **restructure** commands modify the way that event files represent events.

The **summarization** commands produce dataset-wide summaries of various aspects of the data.

(the-remodeling-process-anchor)=
## The remodeling process 

Remodeling consists of applying a list of commands to an events file
to restructure or modify the file in some way.

The following diagram shows a schematic of the remodeling process.

![Event remodeling process](./_static/images/EventRemappingProcess.png)

Initially, the user creates a backup of the event files.
Restructuring applies a sequence of remodeling commands given in a JSON transformation file
to produce a final result.
The transformation file provides a record of the operations performed on the file.
If the user detects a mistake in the transformation,
he/she can correct the transformation file and restore the backup to rerun.

(json-transformation-files-anchor)=
## JSON transformation files

To run the remodeler the most important step is the creation of a JSON transformation file. 
This file provides the remodeler with a list of commands to modify the events.tsv file. 
The file is written in json format. 
Each command is specified in a dictionary along with a description,
and the command parameters. The basic syntax of a remodeler command is provided below with an example.


````{admonition} Basic syntax for a remodeler command.
:class: tip

```json
{ 
    "command": "rename_columns",
    "description": "Rename a trial type column to more specific event_type",
    "parameters": {
            "column_mapping": {"trial_type": "event_type"},
            "ignore_missing": true
    }
}
```
````

All of the remodeler commands have a specific set of required parameters 
that can be found under [**File remodeling tools**](https://hed-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FileRemodelingTools.html#). 
For rename_columns the required commands are `column_mapping` and `ignore_missing`.
Some commands also have optional parameters.

In a remodeler transformation file one or more of these commands should be provided in a list.
These commands will be performed by the remodeler in order. 
It is important to consider the order of the remodeler commands.
In the example below the summary will be performed after the renaming, so it will reflect the new column names.

:class: tip

    {

        "description": "Rename a trial type column to more specific event_type",
        "parameters": {
                "column_mapping": {"trial_type": "event_type"},
                "ignore_missing": true
                }
    },
    {

        "description": "Get all column names across event files to find out if there are missing columns"
        "parameters": {

                "summary_path" "D:\Data\BIDS_dataset\summaries"
                }      
    }
]
```
````

By stacking commands you can make several changes to an event file,
which is important because the changes are always applied to a copy of the original events backup.
If you are planning new changes to the event file, note that you are always changing the original file,
not a previously remodeled events.tsv

For a BIDS dataset the remodeler json file should be saved in the derivatives folder, with `rmdl` as a file suffix.

In the next section we will go over several ways to call the remodeler, and illustrate the use of some commands.

## Using the remodeling tools

The remodeler can be called in a number of ways including using online tools and from the command line.
The following sections explain various ways to use the available tools.

(online-tools-for-debugging-anchor)=
### Online tools for debugging

When first creating a remodeler json file some issues may occur.
Event files may contain unexpected values. Also, it is easy to make mistakes in setting up the json file.
Before running a json file across a dataset, it can be tested on a single file using the HED event online tools
(currently the [**development tools**](https://hedtools.ucsd.edu/hed_dev/events))

In this example we are using the [**sub-0013_task-stopsignal_acq-seq_events.tsv**](./_static/data/sub-0013_task-stopsignal_acq-seq_events.tsv).
of the AOMIC-PIOP2 dataset available on [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org) as ds002790. 
Here is an excerpt of the event file.

(sample-remodeling-events-file-anchor)=
````{admonition} Excerpt from an event file from the stop-go task of AOMIC-PIOP2 (ds002790).
| onset | duration | trial_type | stop_signal_delay | response_time | response_accuracy | response_hand | sex |
| ----- | -------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | --- |
| 0.0776 | 0.5083 | go | n/a | 0.565 | |correct | right | female 
| 5.5774 | 0.5083 | unsuccesful_stop | 0.2 | 0.49 | correct | right | female |
| 9.5856 | 0.5084 | go | n/a | 0.45 | correct | right | female |
| 13.5939 | 0.5083 | succesful_stop | 0.2 | n/a | n/a | n/a | female |
| 17.1021 | 0.5083 | unsuccesful_stop | 0.25 | 0.633 | correct | left | male |
| 21.6103 | 0.5083 | go | n/a | 0.443 | correct | left | male |
````

In this stop-signal task subjects were presented with faces, and had to decide the sex of the face
by pressing a button with their left or right hand. 
Looking at the event file, note that each row represents multiple events. 
The `stop_signal_delay` and `response_time` columns contain information about additional events that happened in the trial, 
besides the go signal presentation.
To get these events represented in a separate row
we can split these events from the original using the `split_event` command.

From the [**Split event**](https://hed-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FileRemodelingTools.html#split-event)
explanation under [**File remodeling tools**](https://hed-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FileRemodelingTools.html#)
we can read all the required parameters for the `split_event` command from the example. 
The required parameters are `anchor_column`, `new_events`, `remove_parent_events`.

The anchor column is the column we want to write the new event name in.
In this case we are specifying new types of events, namely the stop signal, and the response,
so we will add an `anchor_column`: `event_type`. Note that is also possible to choose an existing column as 
an anchor column. The new events will be in new rows, so nothing will be overwritten.

Next we have to specify the new events. This is the most complex part to fill in.
Each new event has a name, which is a key in the new_events dictionary.
For each of these keys we have another dictionary in which we specify the following parameters.

* `onset_source`
* `duration`
* `copy_columns`

The onset source specifies how to come to the onset for the new event. 
It is a list containing a column name, an integer or both. 
When the list contains a column name the remodeler will add the value in this column to 
the onset of the row. If the list contains a number it will add the number to the row onset.
If it contains both they will both be added to the original onset.

In this case the response time and stop signal delay represent the offset compared to trial onset,
so we only need to add the value from the column. Note that the events do not exist for every trial. 
Rows where there was no stop signal have an n/a in the stop_signal_delay column.
This is processed automatically by the remodeler, and no new event is created when the onset_source is missing.

The duration specifies the duration for the new events. In case of the response we set this to 0.
This is acceptable for modeling responses in fMRI studies, but depending on the goals of the study you
might want to set it differently.
The stop signal lasted 500 ms, based on the AOMIC data report. 

The copy columns can be used to transfer context information to the new events from the original parent event.
In this case for the response, we would like to transfer the response_accuracy and the response_hand information.
Transferring the trial_type information is a good idea, because we found that keeping general context information
around is good practice in designing event files.

Last parameter for the `` command is the `remove_parent_event`. 
Sometimes `split_event` can be used to replace the original parent event. 
This is not the case here, since the original event still represents the stimulus presentation.
When the original event is replaced by a new event however,
it is possible for the remodeler to remove the parent event after creating the new events.
Here we set `remove_parent_event` to `false`.

The [**finished json remodeler**](./_static/data/AOMIC_splitevents_rmdl.json) file can now be used to remodel the event file using the online tools.
Currently the remodeler is available in the [**development HED online tools**](https://hedtools.ucsd.edu/hed_dev/events).

In the HED online tools select *remodel file*. The menu will change to what you see below.
Use the indicated browse buttons to upload the events.tsv file and the remodeler json file.
Click process.

![RunRemodelerWebtool](./_static/images/remodeler_webtool.png)

A new file events.tsv file should now be downloaded to your computer. If you followed the example,
it should have the additional rows, and an added column `event_type` with  `response` and `stop_signal` values.

If you are working with your own data, it is possible you did not get a tsv file,
but instead a txt file was downloaded. This txt file will contain error messages returned by the remodeler.

The issue might be an inconsistency in your event file or an error in the remodeler json file.
Carefully read the error message to determine what went wrong, and update the remodeler json file if necessary.

You can quickly and easily repeat the remodeler process on an event file using the HED online tools,
making it ideal for checking and debugging your remodeler json file.

### The command line interface

After installing the remodeler you can it on a full BIDS dataset, 
or any directory with a set of events.tsv files, using the command line interface.
You do this by calling the remodeler and providing it with the necessary arguments.

The main arguments to provide are the path to the root BIDS directory and the path to the json remodeler file.
Depending on the operations you run, there may be other necessary arguments.
A full overview of all arguments is provided under [**File remodeling tools**](https://hed-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FileRemodelingTools.html#remodel-command-arguments-anchor)
If you are not running the remodeler on a directory that is not in BIDS,
you may specify a file extension and suffix to search for.

From the command line it is possible to run summary operations. 
These operations do not return a modified event file but provide a summary of values found in all events.tsv files in a dataset.

If we want to run the split events operation we demonstrated earlier on the full AOMIC dataset, 
we might first want to check whether the response_time exists for all subjects. 
We can do this by running the `summarize_column_headers` operation.

First we prepare the remodeler json file again.

````{admonition} Split events remodeler json file for the AOMIC stop signal task.
:class: tip

```json
[
    {
        "command": "summarize_column_names",
        "description": "Summarize existing column header across entire AOMIC dataset.",
        "parameters": {
            "summary_name": "AOMIC_column_headers",
            "summary_filename": "AOMIC_column_headers"
            }    
    }
]
```
````

This simple summary does not require many input parameters. Like any summary it requires you to indicate
the summary name and the filename to write the summary to. 

Open your computer's command line interface. 
To run the summary we have to provide the following arguments:

* `data dir`
* `-m`, `--model-path`
* `-s`, `--save-formats`
* `-b`, `--bids-format`

The exact paths will look different on your computer but the full command should look something like this:

(remodel-run-anchor)=
````{admonition} Command to run summary on AOMIC dataset.

```bash
python run_remodel.py .\ds002790-data -m .\ds002790\derivatives\models\AOMIC_summarize_rmdl.json -s .txt -b 

```
````

The summaries will be written to a `.\derivatives\summaries` folder the BIDS root folder.
Here we specified we wanted the output in text format. It is also possible to get it in a json file.
By default the summary operations will return both.

The [**summary file**](./_static/data/AOMIC_column_headers_2022_09_14_T_14_38_40_600448.txt) list all different column combinations and for each combination, the files with those columns.
Looking at the different column combinations you can see there are three, one for each task that was performed for this dataset.
All event files for the stop signal task contain the `stop_signal_delay` column and the `response_time` column.

Now you can try out the split_events on the full dataset!

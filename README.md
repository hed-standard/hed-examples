# HED-examples
This repository contains user supporting code and documentation
for using the Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED) system for
annotating, summarizing, and analyzing data.
The repository is organized into three subdirectories:

The [**datasets**](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-examples/tree/main/datasets)
subdirectory contains datasets for testing various aspects of HED.
These datasets have stubs for actual imaging data in order to reduce their size.
Most of these datasets have complete versions available on 
[**openNeuro**](https://openneuro.org/).
See [**datasets/README.md**](./datasets/README.md) for details.

The [**src**](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-examples/tree/main/hedcode)
subdirectory contains Python Jupyter notebooks demonstrating calls to HedTools.
For MATLAB support for HED see the [**hed-matlab**](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-matlab)
GitHub repository.

The [**docs**](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-examples/tree/main/docs)
subdirectory contains the source documentation for this and other HED resources.
The [**HED GitHub organization**](https://github.com/hed-standard/)
gathers the HED supporting resources, all of which are open source.

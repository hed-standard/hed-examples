    "## Sternberg remapping of columns\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the remapping is to provide a finished event file `_eventstemp3.tsv`\n",
    "by remapping the corrected BIDS events files `_eventstemp2.tsv'.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run remapping of `value` to `event_type`, `task_role`, and `letter`.\n",
    "2. Set the `trial` column based on the `ready` value in the `task_role`.\n",
    "3. Count the number of targets in each trial and set the `memory_cond`.\n",
    "4. Change the following `task_role` items based on contents:\n",
    "  1. `remembered_correct` or `ignored_correct` to `continue` if last item in trial.\n",
    "  2. `probe_target` to `probe_nontarget` for probes corresponding to letters ignored in that trial.\n",
    "  3. `probe_target` to `probe_not_shown` for probes corresponding to letters not shown in that trial.\n",
    "  4. `remembered_correct` to `remembered_incorrect` to indicate right button but should have been left.\n",
    "  5. `ignored_correct` to `ignored_incorrect` to indicate left button but should have been right.\n",
    "  6. `bad_trial` if number of events in the trial is not 14 or 13. (Also check that if 13,\n",
    "it is the feedback event that is missing.)"

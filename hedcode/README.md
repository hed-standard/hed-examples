# HED examples

This repository contains user supporting code and documentation
for using the Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED) system for
annotating data. 

The [**HED GitHub organization repository**](https://github.com/hed-standard/)
gathers the HED supporting resources, all of which are open source.

The main documentation for this and other HED resources
is available through the
[**HED-examples**](https://hed-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) documentation,
whose source is contained in the 
[**docs**](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-examples/tree/main/docs)
subdirectory of this repository.

The [**hedcode**](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-examples/tree/main/hedcode)
subdirectory contains MATLAB scripts, Python Jupyter Notebooks,
and Python scripts with direct calls to HedTools.

The [**datasets**](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-examples/tree/main/datasets)
subdirectory contains datasets for testing various aspects of HED.
These datasets have stubs for actual imaging data in order to reduce their size.
Most of these datasets have complete versions available on 
[**openNeuro**](https://openneuro.org/).

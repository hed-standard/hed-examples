# Jupyter notebooks to support remodeling

The Jupyter notebooks in this directory support accessing the HEDTools event
restructuring tools through its command line interface.


## Quickstart

A quickstart overview of the remodeling process and supporting tools can be
found at [**Event file restructuring quickstart](https://hed-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/EventFileRestructuringQuickstart.html).

These notebooks require HEDTOOLS, which can be installed using `pip` or directly.

To use `pip` to install `hedtools` from PyPI:

**NOTE:** The remodeling tools are currently only in the `develop` branch
of the HEDTOOLS and must be installed directly from GitHub.

[GitHub](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-python) repository:

   ```
       pip install git+https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-python/@develop
   ```

HEDTools require python 3.7 or greater.
